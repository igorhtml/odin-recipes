    <img width="400" height="270" alt="Breaded chicken" src="./img/kfc-chicken.jpg">

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>KFC’s fried chicken is made with a blend of herbs and spices, coated in seasoned flour for a crispy, flavorful
        crunch. It’s deep-fried to golden perfection, ensuring a tender and juicy inside.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>500g of chicken breasts and wings</li>
        <li>1 bowl of buttermilk</li>
        <li>1/2 tbsp. garlic paste</li>
        <li>1/2 tbsp. ginger paste</li>
        <li>1 tbsp. salt</li>
        <li>1 tbsp. black pepper</li>
        <li>1 tbsp. mixed dried herbs of your choice</li>
        <li>1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour/plain flour</li>
        <li>1/2 cup cornflour</li>
        <li>1 tsp. paprika powder</li>
        <li>1 egg + 2 tbsp. milk + 2 tbsp. any hot chilli sauce</li>
        <li>oil for deep frying</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Marinate the chicken in the marinade ingredients overnight</li>
        <li>Remove the chicken pieces from the marinade and blot them a little bit with kitchen towels. DO NOT rinse
            them as that will wash away the flavours that have built up during the marination. Set aside on a sieve
            until they come to room temperature.
        </li>
        <li>In a wide plate, mix the flour, cornflour, breadcrumbs/cornflakes, baking powder, salt, paprika, chilli/cayenne, black pepper, garlic powder and onion powder. This will be your seasoned ‘dredging’ flour. In a second plate, whisk the egg with the milk and the hot chilli sauce.</li>
        <li>Prepare a rack on which you will place the chicken pieces to rest after coating, and another raised one lined with some kitchen tissues/towels on which you will remove the chicken after frying.</li>
        <li>Dip each chicken piece first in the beaten egg, then roll it in the seasoned flour. You can repeat if you want a thicker coating, one more time in the egg and then in the flour. Place on a rack and continue until all the chicken pieces are coated and resting on the rack. Let them rest for about 5 minutes so that the coating holds properly to the chicken.</li>
        <li>You can now heat oil in a deep pan. Make sure your oil is to the right temperature. Use a thermometer if you have one  (350 F or 177 C); if not, you’ll know the oil is hot enough when it browns a bit of bread in under 30 seconds.</li>
        <li>Gently, place the chicken pieces into the hot oil, making sure not to overcrowd it. Fry on medium heat for a total of about 12-15 minutes, turning the pieces over once in between.</li>
        <li>Remove the chicken onto the wire rack lined with kitchen towels. This will ensure the chicken remains crispy all around and any excess oil will get blotted off at the same time.</li>
        <li>Allow the chicken to cool for about 10 minutes and then serve! Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
