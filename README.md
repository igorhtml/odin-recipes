# odin-recipes
Simple HTML page to learn and apply my HTML and CSS knowlegde. I will come back later to make this page beautifull!

In this page, I will use my HTML skills to create a simple but well-structured recipe using only HTML. I am currently following The Odin Project to solidify my foundation and be able to escale in web development. I'll further make this page beauty and responsible with CSS.
